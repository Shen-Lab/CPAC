# Cross-Modality and Self-Supervised Protein Embedding for Compound-Protein Affinity and Contact Prediction

## Motivation
Computational methods for compound-protein affinity and contact (CPAC) prediction aim at facilitating rational drug discovery by simultaneous prediction of the strength and the pattern of compound-protein interactions. Although the desired outputs are highly structure-dependent, the lack of protein   structures often force structure-free methods to rely on protein sequence inputs alone.  The scarcity of compound-protein pairs with affinity and contact labels further limits the accuracy and the generalizability of CPAC models.

## Results
To overcome the aforementioned challenges of structure naivety and labeled-data scarcity, we, for the first time, introduce cross-modality and self-supervised learning, respectively, for structure-aware and task-relevant protein embedding.  Specifically, protein data are  available in both modalities of 1D amino-acid sequences and predicted 2D contact maps, that are separately embedded with recurrent and graph neural networks, respectively, as well as jointly embedded with two cross-modality schemes.  Furthermore, both protein modalities are pretrained under various self-supervised learning strategies, by leveraging massive amount of unlabeled protein data.  Our results indicate that individual protein modalities differ in their strengths of predicting affinities or contacts.  Proper cross-modality protein embedding combined with self-supervised learning improves model  generalizability when predicting both affinities and contacts for unseen proteins.

## Experiments
* Cross-modality protein embeddings [[keras]](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC/tree/main/cross_modality_keras) [[pytorch]](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC/tree/main/cross_modality_torch)
* [Pre-training with MLM and GraphComp](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC/tree/main/pretrain_torch)
* [Finetuning](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC/tree/main/finetune_torch)

## Discussions
* For the contact prediction training, we use the [regression loss](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC/blob/d1c7eb2291d79433ab70aa98eb1dbceb72ff6b07/cross_modality_torch/main_concatenation_parallel.py#L150) (where the ground-truth, binary contact matrix was [normalized](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC/blob/d1c7eb2291d79433ab70aa98eb1dbceb72ff6b07/cross_modality_torch/main_concatenation_parallel.py#L83)) rather than the standard [classification loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCELoss.html).
We find that regression loss provides great benefits on precision evaluation (see supplemental results for evidence). One might opt to the loss of the standard binary cross entropy with a non-normalized, binary ground-truth contact matrix, by modifying the codes in the above linked lines. 

## Featurization
To process raw data into input formats of CPAC, we follow the same procedure as in DeepRelations (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00866#) with the detailed description in its supplement (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00866/suppl_file/ci0c00866_si_001.pdf). We further provide a utils file for this purpose: https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC/blob/main/featurization_utils.py.

High-level summary of the featurization:

Proteins graph: Residues as nodes, and edges justified by spatial distances of C-alpha atoms
- Node feature: One-hot embedding of the residue types (mapping dictionary: https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC/blob/bc7fc71e30df7758b3ace2301e00d5f82d4d3965/featurization_utils.py#L2)
- Edges: If structures are present, the adjacency matrix is constructed with a_ij = 1 if  C-alpha distance <= 8 angstroms. If not, computational tools can be used to predict it (Section 1.3 in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00866/suppl_file/ci0c00866_si_001.pdf)

Compound graphs: Atoms as nodes and edge featurization would be more complicated considering chemical topology. A SMILES to compound graph function can be found at: https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC/blob/bc7fc71e30df7758b3ace2301e00d5f82d4d3965/featurization_utils.py#L187.
