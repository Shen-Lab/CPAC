# Cross-Modality and Self-Supervised Protein Embedding for Compound-Protein Affinity and Contact Prediction

## Motivation
Computational methods for compound-protein affinity and contact (CPAC) prediction aim at facilitating rational drug discovery by simultaneous prediction of the strength and the pattern of compound-protein interactions. Although the desired outputs are highly structure-dependent, the lack of protein   structures often force structure-free methods to rely on protein sequence inputs alone.  The scarcity of compound-protein pairs with affinity and contact labels further limits the accuracy and the generalizability of CPAC models.

## Results
To overcome the aforementioned challenges of structure naivety and labeled-data scarcity, we, for the first time, introduce cross-modality and self-supervised learning, respectively, for structure-aware and task-relevant protein embedding.  Specifically, protein data are  available in both modalities of 1D amino-acid sequences and predicted 2D contact maps, that are separately embedded with recurrent and graph neural networks, respectively, as well as jointly embedded with two cross-modality schemes.  Furthermore, both protein modalities are pretrained under various self-supervised learning strategies, by leveraging massive amount of unlabeled protein data.  Our results indicate that individual protein modalities differ in their strengths of predicting affinities or contacts.  Proper cross-modality protein embedding combined with self-supervised learning improves model  generalizability when predicting both affinities and contacts for unseen proteins.
